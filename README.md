The manuscript is created by the `ttiq.Rmd` R-markdown file, which contains (almost) all code required to generate the data and figures.
Running `knitr` on this file will create a PDF manuscript file.
We include serial interval data and modified code from Ferretti et al. medRxiv (2020) [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4033022], which is used to generate parameter estimates for the infectivity profile and generation time distribution.
The files `savedDistributions.RData` and `savedDistributionsLLH.RData` need to be generated by running the `ttiq.Rmd` file as they are too large to attach.
To generate confidence intervals in some plots, we need to run a separate R script for a few hours, as described below.

## Generating confidence intervals
The script `TTIQ-CIscript.R` is used for generating confidence intervals (CI).
It takes an `info` file as an argument, and returns a `.RData` file containing the CI dataframe.
The `info` files are automatically generated when executing the manuscript file.
To run the script, use `R --vanilla --slave < TTIQ-CIscript.R --args INFO-FILENAME-HERE run`.
